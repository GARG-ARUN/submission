<h1>ICE HOCKEY</h1>
<p>
Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually
in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks
to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent'
net to score goals. The sport is known to be fast-paced
and physical, with teams usually fielding six players at
a time: one goaltender, and five players who skate the
span of the ice trying to control the puck and score 
goals.
